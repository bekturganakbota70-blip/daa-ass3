# Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms

## Project Overview
Implementation of Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for optimizing city transportation networks. This project finds the minimum set of roads connecting all city districts with the lowest construction cost.

## Features
- **Prim's Algorithm** with priority queue optimization
- **Kruskal's Algorithm** with Union-Find data structure
- **Graph data structure** with custom Edge and Graph classes
- **JSON input/output** for graph data
- **Comprehensive testing** with JUnit
- **Performance analysis** with operation counting and timing
